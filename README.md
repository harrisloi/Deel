# Deel
An Android mobile application that helps society reduce the problem of food waste by giving vendors a platform to dispose of leftover food and goods. Meanwhile, helping to raise awareness of food waste. Deel also offers a door-to-door food delivery service with real-time monitoring for customers who wish to receive their food and goods.

## Functions of the system 
Deel was developed with two main concepts in mind, one is to reduce the problem of food waste, which is a problem that happens in almost every restaurant and mini-market every day, and the other is an online food ordering system that helps restaurants to promote their food and reputation. In addition, Deel supports a food delivery service to deliver the food to the user. In this way, restaurants can not only upload their unsold food to the mobile app to inform nearby users that a food promotion is currently running, but they can also use the mobile app to accept food orders from users.

Once the user opens the app, the app first detects the user's location, then the system itself feeds the location to a real-time database and the app will then show the user the latest promotions from nearby restaurants. Collecting the user's location data will ensure that they are kept up to date with the latest promotions from nearby restaurants. As soon as a restaurant uploads information about unsold food through the app, the user will be notified of food promotions at nearby restaurants. The user can then place an order for the food and the system will find a nearby delivery driver and assign them to pick up the order from the restaurant and deliver it to the user.
